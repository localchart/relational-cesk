Transformation steps, from direct-style environment-passing
quine-generating interpreter to CESK machine.

1) original direct-style, environment-passing interpreter, with quote
and list, from 2012 Scheme Workshop quines paper

(with updated mk.scm, which generalizes absento)

2) add store argument to eval-expo, which now returns (value . store) pairs as answers

3) update lookupo (Should I make eval-expo and helpers RI wrt environments, stores, and procedures first?  If so, in which step?), to recapture quine generation (apparently the naive lookupo causes divergence)

4) add set! (but not call/cc yet)

5) CPS interpreter

6) reconnect the wires

7) add call/cc (careful with the wires!)
